## Target


## Description

This is a mobile project coded by myself during Rocketseat classes.
This app allows you to manage your financial goals, saving and retrieving data with SQLite, and navigating through screens using Expo Router.

It is a practical opportunity to consolidate essential skills in mobile development while building a functional application.
